      Hi everyone, I'm Tiaon Baraniko from Kiribati one of the Island close to Fiji which is
      located on the equator (toward the east from Hawaii). <br />
      I'm working toward my second certificate and hoping to work toward Web
      development. This is my second year with BYUI and I really enjoying it
      <br />
      I'm married and have two lovely kids. <br />
      I loved playing table tennis and spending time together with my family.
      <br />
      look forward to learn and grow from this course
    </p>
